          <P>
            On the side of my studies, I have done a variety of projects with
            global brands and media outlets such as Arc'teryx, L'Ã‰quipe, CBC,
            and RDS.
          </P>
          <P>
            The experience I got from photography will be very helpful in my
            career as a digital marketer. I learned to create content in a way
            that is aligned to a brand's image and marketing needs. Furthermore,
            I have also gained a great understanding of what goes on behind the
            scenes of the content creation world. I have worked with producers,
            filmmakers, and designers, amongst others; Allowing me to understand
            what they do, what they charge, and how they operate.
          </P>
          <P>
            Today, photography is a passion that I practice when I have time on
            the side of my main activity.
